# RESUME ITERATION PROMPT

### PURPOSE
Support iterative resume refinement by applying suggested edits to the markdown source, then validating against the JD.

---

### INPUT SOURCES
> **Instructions to AI:** Gather these files before making changes.

- **Resume baseline:** `/Users/davideagle/Documents/JobSearch/resume-content.md` **(READ ONLY - never modify this file)**
- **Edit checklist:** `[Role Folder]/resume-edits.md` (generated by jd-resume-compare prompt)
- **Role folder:** Provided by user or most recent in `/Users/davideagle/Documents/JobSearch/InProgress/`

> **IMPORTANT:** `resume-content.md` is the master baseline. All edits go to `[Role Folder]/resume-draft.md`. Never modify the baseline directly.

---

### ITERATION MODES

**Mode 1: "Apply edits"**
> User says: "Apply edits for [Company]" or "Update resume for [Company]"

1. Read `resume-content.md` (current base)
2. Read `[Role Folder]/resume-edits.md` (checklist of changes)
3. Apply each edit to `resume-content.md`:
   - Add missing keywords naturally (don't keyword-stuff)
   - Rephrase bullets as suggested
   - Add quantification where noted
   - Reorder bullets if priority changes suggested
4. Save updated content to `[Role Folder]/resume-draft.md`
5. Output a summary of changes made
6. Mark completed items in `resume-edits.md` with [x]

**Mode 2: "Re-compare"**
> User says: "Re-compare [Company]" or "Check resume for [Company]"

1. Read the latest PDF from the role folder (user has exported from Pages)
2. Read the JD from the role folder
3. Read previous `comparison-analysis.md`
4. Generate a delta report:
   - What improved since last comparison
   - What gaps remain
   - Final fit assessment
5. Append delta to `comparison-analysis.md` with timestamp
6. Update `resume-edits.md` - remove resolved items, add any new ones

**Mode 3: "Targeted edit"**
> User says: "Add [keyword] to resume for [Company]" or "Strengthen [section] for [Company]"

1. Read `resume-content.md` (baseline)
2. Read `[Role Folder]/resume-draft.md` if it exists (or start from baseline)
3. Make the specific requested change
4. Save to `[Role Folder]/resume-draft.md` (never modify baseline)
5. Show the diff of what changed

---

### OUTPUT GUIDELINES

- Preserve the user's voice and style - don't over-polish
- Keep bullets concise (1-2 lines preferred)
- Maintain consistent formatting with the original
- Don't add fluff words or generic phrases
- Quantify where possible, but don't invent numbers

---

### WORKFLOW REMINDER

After AI edits `resume-draft.md`:
1. User reviews the markdown changes
2. User copies relevant changes into their .pages file
3. User exports to PDF
4. User says "re-compare" to validate improvements

---

**COMMAND:** Waiting for user to specify mode and target role.
